    <h3>Heya! Welcome to my profile!</h3>
    <p><em>My name is Thiago, age 23 and im from Brazil. I just got into programming and IT stuff a few months ago, and been a linux user a year i guess.</em></p> 
    <p><em>But i aways had interest in computers since my childhood. The things that computers could do even in 17 years ago still amazes me, and i guess this is my motivation to keep studying, to become a dev that brings solutions to things.</em></p>
